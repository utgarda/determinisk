# Determinisk - zkVM 2D Physics Engine

A deterministic 2D physics engine optimized for zero-knowledge virtual machines (RISC Zero, SP1).

## ðŸŽ‰ Working Proof Generation!

We have successfully generated and verified cryptographic proofs for physics simulations! The system can prove:
- Correct execution of physics simulations
- Deterministic trajectories with gravity
- Ground collision detection  
- Bit-exact reproducibility

```

## Quick Start

### Build with CUDA Support (Docker)

```bash
# Build in Docker with CUDA support (solves GCC 15/CUDA incompatibility)
./build-docker.sh build

# After building, run with GPU-accelerated proving (40x faster than CPU)
./target/release/runner run determinisk-runner/input.toml --prove --backend risc0 --verbose

# Or use built-in scenarios
./target/release/runner run pool_break --prove --backend risc0 --verbose
```

### Run Physics Simulation with Visualization and RISC Zero Proofs

```bash
# Navigate to runner directory
cd determinisk-runner

# Run with RISC Zero real proofs and visualization (CPU proving ~80s)
cargo run --release --features risc0 --bin visual -- input.toml

# Or use a built-in scenario
cargo run --release --features risc0 --bin visual -- pool_break
```

### Run Simulation Without Visualization

```bash
# Run with proof generation and verification (CUDA accelerated: ~2s)
../target/release/runner run input.toml --prove --backend risc0 --verbose

# Run without proof generation
cargo run --release --features risc0 --bin runner run input.toml
```

### Generate Zero-Knowledge Proofs (Legacy)

```bash
# Navigate to RISC Zero directory
cd determinisk-risc0

# Generate a single proof
cargo run --package host --bin host

# Generate multiple proofs with different scenarios
cargo run --package host --example verify_physics_full
```

### Run Physics Examples (without proofs)

```bash
# Build the core library
cargo build

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run examples
cargo run --example simple_drop        # Basic gravity demo
cargo run --example multiple_balls     # Multiple balls with different properties
cargo run --example projectile         # Projectile motion at various angles
cargo run --example pendulum          # Pendulum with position constraints
cargo run --example energy_conservation # Demonstrate energy conservation
cargo run --example determinism_proof  # Prove bit-exact determinism
```

## Examples

### Available Simulations

1. **Simple Drop** - A ball falls under gravity and stops at ground
2. **Multiple Balls** - Several balls with different masses and sizes falling
3. **Projectile Motion** - Launch projectiles at different angles, compare with theory
4. **Pendulum** - Constraint-based pendulum showing energy conservation
5. **Energy Conservation** - Track kinetic/potential energy through simulation
6. **Determinism Proof** - Verify bit-identical results across multiple runs
7. **Benchmark** - Performance testing with various numbers of circles
8. **Orbit Simple** - Demonstration of circular orbital motion

### Performance

With the current implementation (no collision detection):
- 10 circles: ~96 million steps/second
- 100 circles: ~9 million steps/second  
- 500 circles: ~2 million steps/second

All benchmarks run on standard hardware in release mode.

### Example Output

The determinism proof shows perfect reproducibility:
```
âœ“ SUCCESS: All runs produced identical results!

Bit-level precision check:
  Run 1: x_bits = 0xff775fc0, y_bits = 0x00030000
  Run 2: x_bits = 0xff775fc0, y_bits = 0x00030000
  Run 3: x_bits = 0xff775fc0, y_bits = 0x00030000
  Run 4: x_bits = 0xff775fc0, y_bits = 0x00030000
  Run 5: x_bits = 0xff775fc0, y_bits = 0x00030000
```
